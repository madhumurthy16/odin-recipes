     <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A refreshing and healthy smoothie recipe that's perfect for breakfast or a quick snack. Packed with fruits and optional greens, it's a delicious way to start your day.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup frozen mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)</li>
        <li>1 banana</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Greek yogurt (or any yogurt of your choice)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup orange juice (or any juice of your choice)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional, for added sweetness)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup spinach or kale (optional, for added greens)</li>
        <li>Ice cubes (optional, for a thicker smoothie)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, combine the frozen mixed berries, banana, Greek yogurt, and orange juice.</li>
        <li>If you're using honey or maple syrup, add it to the blender for extra sweetness.</li>
        <li>If you want to add greens, include the spinach or kale at this stage.</li>
        <li>Blend on high speed until all the ingredients are well combined and the smoothie is smooth and creamy. If the smoothie is too thick, you can add a little more juice or water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a colder smoothie, you can add a few ice cubes and blend again until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the smoothie into a glass and enjoy immediately. You can also garnish with a few fresh berries or a slice of banana on top for an extra touch.</li>
    </ol>
