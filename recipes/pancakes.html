    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pancakes are a type of flatbread made from a batter and cooked on a griddle or frying pan. They are often served with syrup, butter, and various toppings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat the egg and then whisk in the milk, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract if using.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove from the skillet and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
